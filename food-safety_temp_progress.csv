WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING

Is it really a big deal? Why?
YES. Because FDA (and other regulators) are using it to link pathogen isolates from your food or your facility to human illness.
Didn’t they have systems to do this before? How is this new?
It is a newer technology that is far superior to the previous approach (pulsed field gel electrophoresis; PFGE). In a 2015 article in Scientific American, David Acheson, a former official at both the USDA and the FDA, likened the difference to a witness in a hit and run accident. “While PFGE might identify the vehicle as a brown Toyota Corolla, whole genome sequencing provides the license number and even the vehicle identification number.”
Is this related to the “swab-athons” I’ve heard about, where FDA or states take hundreds of environmental samples?
Yes. Any time they find L. monocytogenes, they are sequencing the isolate and entering it into the database to see if there is a match to illness—even if that illness occurred years ago.
Additional information
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) technology has rapidly evolved in recent years. It is now possible to rapidly and inexpensively sequence bacteria, such as foodborne pathogens, to obtain a “fingerprint”. WGS has been adopted by FDA, USDA and CDC and has been used in microbial foodborne illness investigations for the last several years. Government agencies use a database called GenomeTrakr, which now has over 60,000 bacterial isolates from food and clinical sources. It is vital that the food industry understand the emerging technology and its application.
Food Safety News reported that by using WGS, FDA was able to show that a specific strain of L. monocytogenes in an ice cream production facility was resident (not transient). The company received a warning letter which stated, “The evidence demonstrates that L. monocytogenes has maintained its presence within your production facility since 2015. The reoccurring presence of an identical strain of L. monocytogenes in your environment indicates a resident strain or niche harborage site present in the facility… These findings also demonstrate that your sanitation procedures have historically been inadequate to control, reduce, or eliminate this pathogenic organism from your facility.”
Just because FDA (or USDA FSIS) finds a match between your product or facility and human illness, does it prove that you are at fault? While the single piece of evidence may not be conclusive, you can certainly expect the regulators to come asking questions. A poster presented at the United Fresh Produce Convention in June 2016 described a 2-year study of L. monocytogenes found in multiple packing houses. The researchers, out of Dr. Trevor Suslow’s lab at UC Davis, used different molecular techniques including Whole Genome Sequencing and Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) to sort and characterize the isolates. They found that “Indistinguishable and closely related pulsotypes were observed in the same packing facility on multiple sample collection dates suggesting persistence or residency of a given strain. Furthermore, some L. monocytogenes isolates recovered from different facilities (geographically far apart), in different years were found to have indistinguishable or highly related PFGE pulsotypes.”
More science is needed to understand how quickly different organisms evolve, and the geographic distribution and persistence of “indistinguishable” pathogens. Although there is still a lot to learn about what WGS can and can’t tell us, regulators are nevertheless using this technology and the impact on the fresh produce industry will continue to increase.

Listeria Overview for General Understanding
Listeria monocytogenes remains a food pathogen of priority due to both the severity of listeriosis in humans and the frequency of outbreaks caused by Lm contamination.
Understanding and implementing effective preventive control strategies to reduce, control and/or eliminate the risk of listeriosis in produce grown, packed, manufactured/processed or held is critical.
What is Listeria monocytogenes (Lm, or L. mono)?
Lm are bacteria that cause the foodborne illness Listeriosis.
People can get sick from Lm if they eat a food that is contaminated with Lm.
Foods that have been associated with Lm are raw milk, inadequately pasteurized milk, chocolate milk, cheeses (particularly soft cheeses), ice cream, raw fruits and vegetables, raw poultry and meats (all types), fermented raw-meat sausages, hot dogs and deli meats, and raw and smoked fish and other seafood.
Compared to other foodborne illnesses, such as Salmonella or E. coli, the number of people infected with Listeria is small. However, this bacterium is one of the leading causes of death from foodborne illness.
Who is most at risk?
Pregnant women are more susceptible to Listeria infection. While many pregnant women recover from the illness, their babies do not.
People with weakened immune systems are also more susceptible, such as AIDS and cancer patients.
The elderly are also especially vulnerable.
Why is Listeria monocytogenes a concern to growers, packers and fresh-cut processors?
Listeria can be found in the same environments where fresh fruits and vegetables are grown. It can be found in soil, water and decaying vegetation. It can also establish itself in cold, wet environments, which are common conditions in packing facilities. 
Listeria could possibly be transferred from raw fruits and vegetables from the field and introduced into packing facilities. This transient Listeria could become established in the facility if proper sanitation practices are not carried out. These bacteria that find a home in niches in the facility are often referred to as resident.
This resident Listeria could multiply if conditions are favorable in the facility and then contaminate the produce by moving from facility contact surfaces onto fruits and vegetables.
This cross contamination can be prevented if proper cleaning and sanitation and environmental monitoring programs are established.

TRACEABILITY
Share Tweet
Traceability is a business process that enables trading partners to follow products forward and backward through the supply chain.  
Produce Traceability
Traceability is important to the produce industry for many reasons, including improving food safety by being able to quickly and accurately remove potentially harmful products from the supply chain. 

The Produce Traceability Initiative (PTI) is an industry led initiative to achieve whole chain traceability in the produce supply chain by using common industry data standards and the electronic storage and retrieval of traceability related data.
Traceability has become an issue of great importance to the produce industry due to regulatory requirements such as the U.S. Bioterrorism Act, as well as ongoing food safety issues and the need for supply chain transparency and more information on the produce we grow, pack, ship, store, process, distribute and sell.
The Produce Traceability Initiative was formed in 2008 by representatives from over 40 companies including growers, packer/shippers, marketers, distributors and wholesalers, food service and retail and eight trade associations to begin working on an action plan to ensure the industry has a process that will work for the entire supply chain. 
The Produce Traceability Initiative Steering Committee developed a traceability solution that members felt could be reasonably implemented by produce companies, large and small alike, across the entire supply chain and operating within the U.S. market and those exporting to the U.S. 
Leafy Green Traceability Pilots Reveal the Value of Sharing Extended Product Information During a Traceback Investigation
On December 3, 2020 a group of six industry organizations released a report outlining four months of leafy green traceability pilots with supply chain partners, including growers, distributors and both independent and chain retailers, offering a detailed response to the request by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) for improved traceability in the food system.
The three pilots, conducted July through October, showed that investigations into foodborne illness outbreaks could be streamlined and conducted more effectively when supply chain partners provided extended product information during tracebacks.
Additionally, the use of a standard template called the Produce Traceback Template to exchange pertinent product information was found to enhance the speed of tracing procedures. All of the pilots were successful in tracing the source of the affected product.
Food Traceability in Legislative and Regulatory Circles
While several congressional bills include traceability either as a component or as the exclusive focus including the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), which will encompass a record-keeping rule that focuses on traceability.  
Industry Perspective on Proposed Rule
Growers, fresh-cut processors, distributors, and retail/foodservice sectors each face unique challenges in capturing, managing and linking traceability data, and developed a white paper to share some of these perspectives.
FDA's Product Tracing Pilot Report Released from IFT aligns with PTI
A report, Pilot Projects for Improving Product Tracing Along the Food Supply System Final Report, required by FSMA was published for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT). It provided recommendations on traceability that are consistent with the industry's Produce Traceability Initiative. 

The report aligns with PTI in many of its recommendations, including:
encouraging current industry-led initiatives
not excluding commodities
accepting electronic traceability data/records during product tracing investigations
requiring all organizations that handle food in the supply chain to identify and maintain records of traceability related information
Produce Traceability Initiative Participating Companies
PTI is supported by the volunteer work of dozens of companies that hail from across the fresh produce supply chain, from farm to store to table. Representatives of these companies currently serve as volunteers to PTI's Leadership Council, Executive Committee, working groups and/or task forces.
  Global Food Traceability Center (GFTC)
The Global Food Traceability Center (GFTC) is a collaborative partnership including public and private stakeholders, created to address the challenges and opportunities of global food traceability implementation. 
The Mission of the GFTC is to serve all aspects of the global food system by generating knowledge that addresses informational gaps while delivering applied research, objective advice, and practical expertise about food product traceability and data collaboration for private benefit and public good.  
PMA participates as the sole produce trade association as a founding member and advisory board member of the GFTC. This will ensure the fundamentals of the Produce Traceability Initiative will be adopted by the GFTC as the global standard for fresh produce traceability.
