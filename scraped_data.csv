Exporting food is a complicated process due to the fact that these commodities are directly related to public health and safety.  Fruits and vegetables imported into the U.S. must meet the same regulations as produce produced in the U.S., and products must be safe and contain no prohibited ingredients. Labeling and packaging are also critical components. Exporting is complicated – work with a broker The importance of understanding and complying with importing laws, regulations and requirements cannot be overemphasized. Mexican exporters may wish to obtain guidance from private-sector experts who specialize in importing produce into the U.S. , for example, licensed customs brokers (entry filer), attorneys or consultants. Customs brokers are the only persons authorized by the tariff laws of the United States to act as agents for Mexican exporters in the transaction of their customs business. Customs brokers are private individuals or firms licensed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to prepare and file the necessary customs entries, arrange for the payment of duties, take steps to effect the release of the goods in CBP custody, and otherwise represent their principals in customs matters. Overview of U.S. Agencies Involved in Importing Fruits and Vegetables into the US There are three U.S. government entities involved in the import of fruits and vegetables into the U.S.:  U.S. Department of Agricultural Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) The U. S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determine the admissibility of various food products imported into the United States. The CBP enforces APHIS regulations at ports of entry. CBP agriculture specialists inspect shipments of imported products and ensure that the required permits and phytosanitary certificates (for plant products) accompany each shipment.  USDA’s AMS enforces the federal marketing orders for fruits, vegetables, and specialty crops, as well as compliance with import regulations, including labeling requirements. Laws require specific fruit, vegetable, and specialty crop imports into the United States to meet the same or comparable grade, size, quality and maturity standards as domestic products covered by federal marketing orders.  How to determine if you can export your fruit and vegetable to the U.S.  APHIS makes sure that all imported agricultural products shipped to the United States from abroad meet the agency's entry requirements to exclude pests and diseases of agriculture.  If you want to export fresh fruits and vegetables for consumption, first check the Fruits and Vegetables Import Requirements (FAVIR) database to understand which fruits and vegetables by commodity or country are allowed. This also gives you the general requirements for their exportation to the United States, such as required treatments, special inspections, preclearance status, and/or approved arrival ports.  To export foreign fruits and vegetables, you must apply for an agricultural import permit from APHIS and obtain a phytosanitary certificate from the exporting country. Attached is an APHIS Factsheet: Importing Food and Agricultural Products into the United States in Spanish.  Overview of FDA requirements Under provisions of U.S. law contained in the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, importers of food products, including fruits and vegetables, are responsible for ensuring that the products are safe, sanitary, and labeled according to U.S. requirements.  Exporters and/or importers of fruits and vegetables must register with FDA. All commercial food products are subject to prior notice filing with FDA.  Imported fruits and vegetables are subject to FDA inspection upon arrival at U.S. ports of entry. FDA may detain shipments of products if they are found not to be in compliance with U.S. requirements.  Overview of CBP requirements CBP enforces the requirements set forth from APHIS and the FDA to allow fruits and vegetables to enter the U.S.  CBP will not release food shipments without proof that prior notice (PN) has been filed with FDA. Therefore, it is imperative that the PN satisfied number is submitted to CBP along with the entry documents. The PN satisfied number should be annotated on the shipping documents (i.e. bill of lading or airway bill). In addition to the PN requirement, once the goods arrive in the U.S., FDA may collect a sample or tell CBP to proceed with releasing the shipment. If a sample is in violation of FDA regulations, you will receive a Notice of Detention from FDA. To find out the status of food that has been detained by FDA, call the number referenced on the detention notice or the main number for Import Operations and Policy at (301) 443-6553. View the CBP's Guide: Importing into the United States A Guide for Commercial Importers  Overview of USDA AMS Requirements  It is the responsibility of the importer of record to have each imported lot (shipment) inspected for grade and quality by AMS. The importer is defined as the party responsible for clearing the goods through customs and could be the shipper, the receiver, or a third party such as a broker or attorney of record. As of September 1, 2016, all imported fruit and vegetables subject to AMS regulation must be presented for inspection to AMS or its Federal-State partners as separate lots that correspond to each individual Customs Entry Number.  View more information on USDA's AMS import requirements Other considerations for Mexican fresh produce exporters  While the information presented here provides a high-level summary of agencies a Mexican exporter may need to work with, there are many other details, regulations and paperwork needed for compliance. It is best to work with a broker. Additionally, this document notes formal regulations necessary for exporting fruits and vegetables to the U.S. However, there may be additional requirements specific to U.S. buyers, such as food safety certifications, labeling or packaging.  Overview of Mexican Agencies Involved in Exporting Fruits and Vegetables from Mexico If you are exporting fruits and vegetables to the U.S. from Mexico, you must understand the Mexican agencies and regulations associated with the process. Here is a high-level summary of Mexican government agencies’ role: SENASICA  SENASICA protects agriculture, water and livestock resources from economic and quarantine importance pests and diseases. Additionally, it regulates and promotes the application and certification of the food contamination risk reduction systems and its agri-food quality to facilitate the vegetal and animal-based domestic and international trade.  SAGARPA SAGARPA promotes supporting policies to improve production, make better use of the comparative advantages of the agricultural sector, integrate rural environment into the rest of the economy’s productive supply chains, and incite growers’ organizations collaboration within their own programs and projects.  SAT SAT is responsible for applying the fiscal and customs legislation with the goal that both individuals and companies contribute to public expenses on a proportional and equitable basis, inspect tax payers so they comply with tax and customs provisions; facilitate and encourage voluntary compliance, and generate and provide the necessary information for the design and evaluation of the tax policy.  COFEPRIS COFEPRIS establishes and implements politics, programs and projects at the level of international best practice, under effective coordination with the different players in the public, private and social sectors, to prevent and assist on sanitary risks, contributing to public health.  Documents required to Export Fresh Produce to the U.S.  Attached is a summary guide to export fresh fruits and vegetables from Mexico, including the documents required by the customs broker to export. It is valuable for any Mexican exporter or Mexican companies interested in exporting to the U.S.:  1. Required export documents for a customs broker in Mexico and the Mexican government phytosanitary requirements.  2. Required export documents for a customs broker in the U.S. and the U.S. government phytosanitary requirements.

"8 Steps to Consider When Creating a Technology Roadmap","https://www.freshproduce.com/resources/technology/technology-roadmap/","Technology","TECHNOLOGY 8 Steps to Consider when Creating a Technology Roadmap IFPA HOME RESOURCES TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP Share Tweet Email JANUARY 16, 2019  1. Look for your pain points and be willing to change. Each business is different, and while we share some common pain points, others may be more specific. A technology solution that meets the needs of one type of operation may be useless to another. Sometimes we get so busy running the day-to-day operations of our businesses, we don’t take the time to look at the business environment around us. What are the new trends? What’s the competition doing? What do my customers want? What are my business needs? Step back, examine your business and find your true pain points. The second gift you can give yourself is to be open to change. It’s human nature to be uncertain of change, or to even fear it. But in this ever-competitive environment we work in, chances are, you are going to have to change your operations. In fact, that’s really what this is about: making changes that render your operation more cost effective, sustainable, efficient, and better suited to meet your customers’ needs. Only one certainty – if you don’t continue to evolve your business, others will make those changes and you could find yourself out of business. 2. Develop awareness of technologies, develop connections and engage with entrepreneurs and vendors. Find sources of information. Connect with entrepreneurs and start-ups. And don’t forget about established technology and service providers who are offering new opportunities, upgraded technology products and services. Lastly, engage. Trade associations and universities are always providing opportunities to engage. Go to demonstrations, work with technology providers to test equipment and develop a sense of whether that technology product is a solution to your pain point. 3. Evaluate your current systems and map where you want to go. Ever stand back in your field, packinghouse, processing plant or distribution facility and just watch? Is what you see efficient? Do you have too many workers, or too few? Does the product flow evenly or stop and start? Does the product move from one part of the operation to another to create efficiencies? Do you have equipment that can generate digital data? Can you collect and analyze that data? Can pieces of equipment communicate with each other? What measures do you currently have in place to help you identify where you might get better? Can you measure how much each step costs you? Are there cost savings there? What are the financial implications (cost of capital versus operational costs, ROI, opportunity to increase business, threat of business loss to competition)? Are your production processes choreographed like a ballet, or do they look like a crowd exiting a football stadium going every which way? You need to map your process. Identify where you should make changes to improve efficiencies, quality, safety. Identify the priorities and know what your timelines and resources are. 4. Check upstream and downstream. You have to think of what you are doing as a process. You want to build in efficiencies; not move your problems upstream or downstream from your new technology. Components of your process all need to work together. If one operation works faster than another, then you just build up behind that step and you don’t really gain any speed, efficiency or cost savings. Check upstream and downstream of where you want to make a change. You need to synchronize steps so they work together and the whole process gains speed, cost savings, and more consistency. You have to think of controlling and improving the whole process, whatever your production process might be. 5. Adopting a new technology has costs. There are a variety of ways to understand what those costs are. You can look at the cost of the new equipment and add in installation. There also may be some business disruption costs because you have to assume some decline in productivity while the new system or process gets up and running. There are training costs to learn how to use the new technology, and there might be ongoing data collection and analytics costs and so on. Don’t forget that if you invest in this technology, it might mean that you lose the opportunity to invest elsewhere in your business. And, of course, somewhere in the process, you need to determine what success would look like to you and then consider your probabilities of attaining success. Hand in hand with that analysis, you also have to look at the upsides. What new opportunities might come your way as a result of the investment? Can you retain current customers? Can you gain new customers? Can you expand your capacity? Can you develop new product lines? Can you reduce input costs, such as energy or water? What might happen if you don’t invest? Can you stay competitive? What is the time horizon for your business? 6. Selecting your supplier or vendor is always important. When you buy a car, price is always important, but most of us look for information on how other owners have fared with that model. We might talk with our neighbors or relatives, or check the internet and other sources for information. We might shop around a bit and look at alternatives. We always look at service. Do they have a good track record? Do they have the parts? Do they have the knowledge and mechanics? Does the shop have long waiting lists for appointments? How far are they away from my home? We have to go through the same process when selecting a provider for a new technology. Your new technology is going to require modifications, it will break down, and it will be upgraded. Can your provider give you that service? Do they have the parts and the expertise? Can they train your staff? What is their track record? Having the right supplier makes implementation easier. 7. Implement. Implementation might be one of the hardest things to do. It often means operational disruption and it is hard to turn back. It can sometimes mean running in parallel streams. For example: implementing a mechanized harvester might mean using the machine but continuing to use a harvest crew for a certain time period because you can’t be out of product. Changing a packing line into an automated line might entail the same. Chances are, the introduction of the automated line will take some time to perfect, and you have orders to make so you run in parallel. This is also where any asynchronies will show up, i.e. where one part of your process might outstrip another unexpectedly. Training is critical – how do you use the equipment, and what do you do about people issues? Do you have the talent to run more sophisticated equipment? How about sanitation challenges and food safety issues? Does the technology change the product? Are you communicating with your customers? 8. Assess and fine tune. Nobody gets it exactly right the first time. Part of defining success is choosing the appropriate measurements to assess that progress. You might need outside expertise to assist. Choose vendors that can help. Assessment can be both operational (workflow, labor, product quality) and financial. Are you achieving the efficiencies you sought?

"FSMA 204 Traceability Rules Think Tank","https://www.freshproduce.com/resources/supply-chain-management/fsma-204-traceability-rules-think-tank/","Food Safety","FSMA 204 Traceability Rules IFPA Think Tank IFPA HOME RESOURCES SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT FSMA 204 TRACEABILITY RULES THINK TANK Share Tweet Email Sponsored by: FDA released the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) 204 Final Rule establishing additional recordkeeping requirements for persons who manufacture, process, pack or hold foods FDA has designated for inclusion on the Food Traceability List (FTL). The rule went into effect on January 20, 2023 and will be enforced starting on January 20, 2026. The rule applies to persons who manufacture, process, pack, or hold foods that appear on the Food Traceability List or foods that contain a listed food as an ingredient, unless an exemption applies. Although the FSMA 204 Final Rule covers more than just fresh produce, similar to the Produce Traceability Initiative (PTI), the produce industry is leading the way on FSMA 204 Final Rule implementation for other industries to follow. The FSMA 204 Traceability Rules Think Tank explored how the FSMA 204 Final Rule regulations and implementation will be used by buyers, and how IFPA can assist buyers during the implementation period. Additionally, IFPA learned how to best support members from an information and advocacy perspective as IFPA communicates with FDA.  It is clear the industry is at different stages of confusion regarding the rule’s expectations and requirements. Some noted there is confusion among suppliers and others between the differences between the FSMA rule and PTI best practices. Many buyers need assistance with identifying compliance expectations for their supplier base, and then identifying how those expectations get conveyed to their distribution network. There is widespread agreement that there needs to be more specifics and clarity communicated on the rule, with IFPA leading the way. Standardizing rules for all produce commodities Although the rule technically applies only to foods that appear on the FTL, one of the most important takeaways from the Think Tank was that the industry is determined to implement one set of rules for all produce items, regardless of if the commodities are on the FTL. Simply put, buyers will expect companies to comply with the same set of regulations in the FSMA 204 Final Rule for all commodities. It was noted that companies may experience some pushback from supply chain partners on this expectation, but it was agreed that it is crucial to have the same processes for all commodities in order to improve traceability and avoid confusion between different labeling processes for different commodities. Additionally, distribution centers are not willing or able to manage multiple processes based on different commodities. Establishing minimum requirements of the rule The second major takeaway from the discussion was the need to standardize the requirements of the rule across all buyers. Many noted that there has to be absolute minimum requirements established otherwise suppliers will be burdened with too many processes. Additionally, without minimum requirements, retailers will all have different expectations for what data they need to capture and store from their suppliers. The Think Tank participants were very supportive of requiring every company to follow the same set of requirements posed by the rule, similar to the process that was followed for the PTI Harmonized Label. Establishing a minimum set of requirements will help companies’ operations be as efficient as possible in complying with the rule. Currently, some suppliers use a non PTI Harmonized Case Label and often there is multiple barcodes and even QR codes which can make it confusing for the receiver identify the traceability lot code. There must be a clear way to identify which barcode is the traceability lot code. Central to the rule’s operation, a traceability lot code is a descriptor, often alphanumeric, used to identify a traceability lot. Traceability lot consists of a batch or lot of food that has been initially packed, received by the first land-based receiver, or transformed. A brand-new data requirement in the FSMA 204 Final Rule is the traceability lot code source. This is the contact information of the location where a food was packed or transformed, and assigned a traceability lot. Conducting pilots for FDA Several participants expressed the need to receive increased clarity from FDA on lot traceability expectations. Fortunately, there is widespread interest and willingness among the industry to work with the FDA to conduct traceability pilots. There are natural error rates in shipping product, whether from missing labels, broken labels, or incorrect information on a pallet. Conducting pilots and collecting data will help show FDA realistic expectations for compliance, namely, the accuracy rate that can be reasonably expected with available methods. Otherwise, companies may experience higher costs and less efficient operations by trying to reach an unrealistic lot number accuracy metric for compliance. The hope is that allowing for a margin for error will actually help speed up the identification of the source of the pathogen by removing 100% accuracy assumptions. PTI’s FSMA workgroup will include pilots, so the industry may be able to demonstrate to FDA the realistic accuracy of tracking lot numbers in stores or restaurants. Instead of needing to provide just one lot number, the hope is that the industry can provide a range of lot numbers from a pick slot at a given time. Several participants noted the need for a standardized template for a sortable spreadsheet to help with compliance and to get back to the source of an outbreak as quickly as possible, especially with multi-state outbreaks with a lot of locations and data. The spreadsheet will be the best way to record traceability data and will inform any gaps that need to be filled for records. Ultimately, once there is consensus from the industry on a workable spreadsheet, data will be recorded and shared with FDA using this template. Communicating with supply chain partners A common concern voiced is the amount of time and work will be required to train sometimes hundreds of suppliers and dozens of distribution centers on the processes to follow to comply with the rule so no loads get rejected. Additionally, buyers noted the challenge the rule will present working with the sometimes inadequate or insufficient data and records of their supply chain partners, namely smaller distribution centers, suppliers, and farmers, who sometimes have outdated technology and methods of keeping data. It will be imperative to make sure all partners understand the rule is not a recommendation or suggestion; it’s a requirement. This was referenced as an issue with the rollout of PTI. However, this must be balanced with the need to be sensitive to suppliers to avoid adding extra work and costs. It was suggested that retail and foodservice sectors of the supply chain need to work together and communicate with suppliers and distribution centers on the expectations for complying with the rule. One idea presented was that retailers can lead knowledge transfer sessions with suppliers and other partners to ensure all expectations will be met. It is important to reach alignment from the buying community in order to properly educate the supply chain and work together with partners effectively. Specifically, buyers need to agree to use the harmonized PTI label and standardized electronic Advanced Shipment Notifications (PTI ASNs) and understand what is going to be required of them and their partners in the next three years.   Identifying Next Steps IFPA is already discussing standardizing expectations of the rule across different industries with FMI. Going forward, it was recommended that at least one member of each company be part of PTI’s FSMA workgroup that meets every three weeks to identify everything included in the rule. The workgroup will communicate out on the expectations of the rule, provide best practices for compliance, and educate the industry more fully on the rule. To help companies get aligned on expectations of the rule, the Think Tank participants requested IFPA provide a timeline of milestones to help them comply with the rule until it is enforced in 2026. It was recommended that IFPA serve as the point of contact to guide people on meeting certain milestones for 2023, 2024 and 2025. The participants were interested in meeting again, next time with a few major decision points to make heading into the meeting.
