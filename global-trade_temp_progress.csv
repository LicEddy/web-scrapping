HOW TO EXPORT MEXICAN FRESH PRODUCE TO THE US
Share
If you are interested in exporting fruits and vegetables to the U.S., you must understand all U.S. requirements and regulations associated with the process, including necessary documentation. Exporting food is a complicated process due to the fact that these commodities are directly related to public health and safety. 
Fruits and vegetables imported into the U.S. must meet the same regulations as produce produced in the U.S., and products must be safe and contain no prohibited ingredients. Labeling and packaging are also critical components.
Exporting is complicated – work with a broker
The importance of understanding and complying with importing laws, regulations and requirements cannot be overemphasized. Mexican exporters may wish to obtain guidance from private-sector experts who specialize in importing produce into the U.S. , for example, licensed customs brokers (entry filer), attorneys or consultants. Customs brokers are the only persons authorized by the tariff laws of the United States to act as agents for Mexican exporters in the transaction of their customs business. Customs brokers are private individuals or firms licensed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to prepare and file the necessary customs entries, arrange for the payment of duties, take steps to effect the release of the goods in CBP custody, and otherwise represent their principals in customs matters.
Overview of U.S. Agencies Involved in Importing Fruits and Vegetables into the US
There are three U.S. government entities involved in the import of fruits and vegetables into the U.S.: 
U.S. Department of Agricultural
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)
Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS)
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)
The U. S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determine the admissibility of various food products imported into the United States. The CBP enforces APHIS regulations at ports of entry. CBP agriculture specialists inspect shipments of imported products and ensure that the required permits and phytosanitary certificates (for plant products) accompany each shipment.

USDA’s AMS enforces the federal marketing orders for fruits, vegetables, and specialty crops, as well as compliance with import regulations, including labeling requirements. Laws require specific fruit, vegetable, and specialty crop imports into the United States to meet the same or comparable grade, size, quality and maturity standards as domestic products covered by federal marketing orders. 
How to determine if you can export your fruit and vegetable to the U.S.

APHIS makes sure that all imported agricultural products shipped to the United States from abroad meet the agency's entry requirements to exclude pests and diseases of agriculture.

If you want to export fresh fruits and vegetables for consumption, first check the Fruits and Vegetables Import Requirements (FAVIR) database to understand which fruits and vegetables by commodity or country are allowed. This also gives you the general requirements for their exportation to the United States, such as required treatments, special inspections, preclearance status, and/or approved arrival ports. 
To export foreign fruits and vegetables, you must apply for an agricultural import permit from APHIS and obtain a phytosanitary certificate from the exporting country.
Attached is an APHIS Factsheet: Importing Food and Agricultural Products into the United States in Spanish.

Overview of FDA requirements
Under provisions of U.S. law contained in the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, importers of food products, including fruits and vegetables, are responsible for ensuring that the products are safe, sanitary, and labeled according to U.S. requirements. 
Exporters and/or importers of fruits and vegetables must register with FDA. All commercial food products are subject to prior notice filing with FDA.

Imported fruits and vegetables are subject to FDA inspection upon arrival at U.S. ports of entry. FDA may detain shipments of products if they are found not to be in compliance with U.S. requirements.

Overview of CBP requirements
CBP enforces the requirements set forth from APHIS and the FDA to allow fruits and vegetables to enter the U.S. 
CBP will not release food shipments without proof that prior notice (PN) has been filed with FDA. Therefore, it is imperative that the PN satisfied number is submitted to CBP along with the entry documents. The PN satisfied number should be annotated on the shipping documents (i.e. bill of lading or airway bill).
In addition to the PN requirement, once the goods arrive in the U.S., FDA may collect a sample or tell CBP to proceed with releasing the shipment. If a sample is in violation of FDA regulations, you will receive a Notice of Detention from FDA. To find out the status of food that has been detained by FDA, call the number referenced on the detention notice or the main number for Import Operations and Policy at (301) 443-6553.

Overview of USDA AMS Requirements 
It is the responsibility of the importer of record to have each imported lot (shipment) inspected for grade and quality by AMS. The importer is defined as the party responsible for clearing the goods through customs and could be the shipper, the receiver, or a third party such as a broker or attorney of record.
As of September 1, 2016, all imported fruit and vegetables subject to AMS regulation must be presented for inspection to AMS or its Federal-State partners as separate lots that correspond to each individual Customs Entry Number.

Other considerations for Mexican fresh produce exporters 
While the information presented here provides a high-level summary of agencies a Mexican exporter may need to work with, there are many other details, regulations and paperwork needed for compliance. It is best to work with a broker.
Additionally, this document notes formal regulations necessary for exporting fruits and vegetables to the U.S. However, there may be additional requirements specific to U.S. buyers, such as food safety certifications, labeling or packaging.

Overview of Mexican Agencies Involved in Exporting Fruits and Vegetables from Mexico
If you are exporting fruits and vegetables to the U.S. from Mexico, you must understand the Mexican agencies and regulations associated with the process. Here is a high-level summary of Mexican government agencies’ role:
SENASICA 
SENASICA protects agriculture, water and livestock resources from economic and quarantine importance pests and diseases. Additionally, it regulates and promotes the application and certification of the food contamination risk reduction systems and its agri-food quality to facilitate the vegetal and animal-based domestic and international trade. 
SAGARPA
SAGARPA promotes supporting policies to improve production, make better use of the comparative advantages of the agricultural sector, integrate rural environment into the rest of the economy’s productive supply chains, and incite growers’ organizations collaboration within their own programs and projects. 
SAT
SAT is responsible for applying the fiscal and customs legislation with the goal that both individuals and companies contribute to public expenses on a proportional and equitable basis, inspect tax payers so they comply with tax and customs provisions; facilitate and encourage voluntary compliance, and generate and provide the necessary information for the design and evaluation of the tax policy.

COFEPRIS
COFEPRIS establishes and implements politics, programs and projects at the level of international best practice, under effective coordination with the different players in the public, private and social sectors, to prevent and assist on sanitary risks, contributing to public health.

THE EUROPEAN GREEN DEAL: OVERVIEW AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRODUCE
Share Tweet Email
The European Green Deal is a Europe’s economic, social, and environmental growth strategy moving forward. The European Commission is committed to supporting this strategy through transformative policies and direct investment. If you do business in the EU, or have European business partners, this will affect your organization over the coming years. Here, we bring you the basics of what the Green Deal is and start to unpack what this will mean for our industry both in Europe and around the world.

Motivated by the social, economic, and environmental consequences of global climate change, the Green Deal strives to achieve one landmark goal: to be completely carbon neutral by the year 2050. Moreover, they commit to achieving this goal while at the same time both breaking the link between economic growth and resource use, and ensure that all no one is left behind. This is a completely radical ambition, not just paying lip service to sustainability but making it the star of the show for the largest trade block in the world. 
Under the Green Deal, the commission has been and will continue to roll out relevant policy. The following are the identified policy areas, and how they connect to our industry.
Policy Areas:
Biodiversity
The produce industry is, of course, dependent on plant crops, all of which are derived from naturally occurring species that have been brought into cultivation. Maintaining biodiversity on our planet provides sources for diversity in our products.
Farm to Fork
The produce supply chain will be directly affected by new policies that address how food moves from the field to consumers.
Sustainable Agriculture
Growers will need to adapt their farming practice to be in compliance.
Clean Energy
The exact implementation is to be determined, but this policy area will likely have a more diffuse affect on the produce industry.
Sustainable Industry
Processing and packaging operations will be affected under this policy area, as the Green Deal champions environmentally friendly production techniques and facilities.
Building and Renovating
Produce will be tangentially affected here as shippers, warehouses, and processors upgrade or build new facilities.
Sustainable Mobility
To achieve net carbon neutrality, the Green Deal scrutinizes many sources of greenhouse gas emissions, including transportation. Shippers in the produce industry will be directly affected by this policy area.
Climate Action
This is the direct goal of getting the EU to a point of carbon neutrality by 2050. This broad area can cover any point source of greenhouse gas emissions not directly addressed above. 
The EU Green Deal is revolutionary and vast in its scope.  Any single major policy shift will have a broad reaching ripple effect throughout an industry, and here we are looking at multiple policy areas. Luckily, we have the gift of time when it comes to the Green Deal: by unveiling the vision of this before the policies all go into effect, our industry has time to anticipate and invest to succeed because of, rather than in spite of, these changes. 
We can look at the Green Deal as an opportunity to invest and make our businesses more sustainable on a level playing field. Rather than having to consider whether an investment into sustainability will make your business less competitive, remember that most of your peers will have to make those same investments to maintain access to the European market. This has two effects. First, eco-friendly products will become more affordable to you. We have seen this very clearly throughout history: as expensive new technology becomes widely adopted, it becomes cheaper. Here, the Green Deal will essentially force the adoption of new technologies to achieve sustainability goals, and the cost to make your business more sustainable will decrease as a result. Second, the entire industry will be investing and making changes in their businesses to meet the Green Deal policy requirements. While there is a concern that these efforts will cut into margins, remember that it will do so for your competitors as well. 
In many ways, the Green Deal reflects values that we already hold dear: access to fresh, healthy food that nourishes our global population. As the EU Green Deal unfolds in a series of policy changes, we are here to support our members as you navigate these changes and maximize the benefits for your businesses. The power of the EU is that the scale of this initiative will likely lead the global industry towards a greener world. As companies change how they do business and make the investments necessary to enter the European market, they will inevitably become more competitive in other markets because of the higher quality of their products and higher social standards under which they do business. The EU has taken a stance, and the world of fresh will follow.

SOUTHEAST ASIA'S FRESH PRODUCE TRADE
Share Tweet Email
Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand are the key fresh fruit producers in Southeast Asia. The region primarily exports fresh fruit, which has increased over the last three years, but overall the region remains a net fresh produce importer.
This article details Southeast Asia's role in global fresh produce production and the key countries producing, importing and exporting in the region.
Fresh Produce Trade
Southeast Asia produces approximately 7 percent share of global fresh produce quantity and production has grown 3 percent over the three-year period of 2011-2013. Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand are the key fresh fruit producers in this region. In addition to its production, the region is a net fresh produce importer.
Exports
The region primarily exports fresh fruit — accounting for a 4 percent share of global fresh fruit export value. The Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam are the leading exporters in the region.
Exports are increasing. Southeastern Asia’s fresh fruit exports averaged annual increases of more than 30 percent between 2010 and 2013, outpacing the global fresh fruit export growth rate of an average 20 percent.
Imports
Southeast Asia is a net fresh produce importer, and accounts for a 4 percent share of global fresh produce imports. Fruit imports are growing — on average 20 percent annually in the last three years. Apples, other fresh fruits, citrus and grapes are the top fresh fruits imported. Apple, grape and mango imports are driving growth.
Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam are among leading growth markets for fresh food globally, posting double digit consumption growth between 2010 and 2015. For fresh produce specifically, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore are the key import markets in Southeastern Asia.
Trade
ASEAN currently has six key Free Trade Agreements (FTA) with Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea. And there is talk of creating a single FTA between these six countries and ASEAN, a more interconnected trade deal within a trade deal (Euromonitor). In addition, ASEAN is currently negotiating a free trade agreement with the EU.
ASEAN members including Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam are also currently part of negotiations for the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), the largest trade deal to be negotiated to date, and will liberalize trade among economies in the Asia Pacific and Americas regions.
Opportunities & Challenges for Fresh Produce in Southeast Asia
Southeast Asia’s strong economic performance and forecasted growth will continue to drive development in the region. Increased urbanization and a youthful population with increasing purchasing power will fuel this growth.
Although much of its current trade is concentrated in the Asia Pacific region (China, Japan, etc.), Southeast Asia is positioned to diversify its trade base with the impending Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) Trade Agreement which could broaden trade in the Pacific Rim with the Americas. The TPP will create first-time trade deals among many of the countries involved in the negotiations. Malaysia and Vietnam have had no prior trade deals with the U.S., Mexico or Peru. Reduced or eliminated tariffs are expected for the trade of agricultural products.
Additionally, through the ASEAN integration, the goal of creating a single market of more than 600 million consumers will be realized along with their manufacturing and services industries streamline trade flowing to and from the region.
Insufficient infrastructure, higher unemployment among the youth, and known corruption affecting many of the countries in the region could hinder foreign investment and development. Additionally, the region is prone to floods, which could impact infrastructure development and agricultural production.

WHO SUPPLIES THE MIDDLE EAST’S INCREASING DEMAND FOR FRESH PRODUCE
Share Tweet Email
According to The Economist, the growing populations of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, also called the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), point to increased dependence on imported food staples. Food imports are projected to grow to US$53.1 billion by 2020. Major factors driving the GCC market include growing domestic and expat population, rising health consciousness among the population, changing tastes and preferences, and growing disposable income leading to higher consumption of nutritional foods as part of a stable diet.
The United Nations’ figures reveal the population of GCC countries jumped by 18.9 percent in the last five years. In countries like Saudi Arabia the birth rate has topped 20 percent consistently in recent years. According to a report published by the Economist Intelligence Unit, by 2020 the GCC population is forecast to reach 53.5m, a 30 percent increase over the level in 2000. 
IFPA reports that consumers with changing tastes are willing to pay a premium for an assortment of produce offering freshness, quality, flavor, safety and convenience. “Young and affluent Western food-loving consumers are driving the growth and demand for imported goods and foods in the Middle East,” states an analyst from Mintel. In addition, there are healthy eating efforts toward purchasing more fruits and vegetables. Falling groundwater and aquifer levels in the Arabian Peninsula, limited rainfall, arid climate, overreliance on imports and rising soil salinity are affecting the fruits and vegetables market. The region’s dependence on desalinated water means that meeting more of its food needs through domestic production is not an option in the long term. 
Key import markets in the Middle East
Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait and Egypt are the largest markets for fresh produce imports. Saudi Arabia and the UAE account for over 2 percent of global fresh produce imports, and Saudi Arabia fresh produce imports are growing at a faster rate than global imports in the last five years.
Top items imported
Citrus and berries are sizeable categories growing in the last three years. Berries increased +8% CAGR from 2014 through 2016.
Who supplies the growing import markets in the Middle East?
In total, the Middle East is a net fresh produce exporter. About 40 percent of the Middle East’s fresh produce imports are supplied by other Middle Eastern countries, with Egypt and Turkey being the two largest suppliers. But various other countries supply the rest. 
The growing markets for fresh produce in Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait have increased supply from various countries including South Africa, Europe, Latin America, and the Asia Pacific region, including Australia and India.

2021 FRESH PRODUCE RETAIL IN CHINA
Share Tweet Email
China’s fresh produce retail market is impressive not only for its present scale, but also its vast untapped potential. The market value for fresh goods (fresh produce, meat, eggs, dairy, seafood) was $738 billion in 2019, of which $407 billion was for fresh produce. But viewed from a per capita perspective, annual retail spending on fresh goods in 2020 was only $525.

China is in the midst of a steady march from middle-income to developed country status, which is spurring an unprecedented increase in the size of the middle class and a continuous upgrading of consumer consumption patterns. Under prevailing economic conditions, China’s fresh produce retail market is poised for strong growth in coming years.
